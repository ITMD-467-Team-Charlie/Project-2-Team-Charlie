## Problem 
Have you had problems trying to find better eating habits that is more suited for you?  Have you ever wished that there was a way to just look at certain dieting plans with the convenience of your phone/web browser?  There are certain foods that we eat that cause negative effects on our health and quality in life.  Although eating healthy can be fairly simple, the rise in popular “diets” and dieting trends has caused a lot of confusion.  In fact, these trends often distract from the basic nutrition principles that are most important for all of our personal needs.  

## Solution 
Some users may use our site, not even knowing what they are looking for in the first place.  With our assistance, we can suggest and provide guides, articles, and plans to better eating that suit you. We implemented a form that asks the user about their body dimensions, and calculates their BMI and BMR based from their results.  From there, we bring the user to a page that displays suggested meals that can help better suit to their dieting plan.  These meals have their nutritional facts displayed, and you can further advice to what meals you want to try by clicking on the photo of it.  We also create an account for you so you can come back to previous meals that you have saved on your browser history.
